\section{Gallium Arsenide Semiconductor}
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of $~1.42eV$ at room temperature. The experimental values for effective masses (in unit of free electron mass) are: $0.067$, $0.082$ and $0.45$ for electrons in the conduction band as well as light and heavy holes at the of the valence bands, respectively. 

The band structure of some semiconductors, including GaAs, around the point $\Gamma$ can be approximated by
\begin{equation}
E(\vb{k}) = E_0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m*}(\vb{k}^2 - \Gamma) = C + Ak^2,
\end{equation}
where $m^*$ is the effective mass.
